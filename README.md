## Implementation of Model

A Kinematic model was used for the controller. Tire force and gravity are ignored in this model.The model equations are as follow:

          x_next = x_i + v * cos(psi_i) * dt;
          
          y_next = y_i + v * sin(psi_i) * dt;
          
          psi_next = psi_i - v * steering_angle * dt / mpc.Lf;
          
          v_next = v + throttle * dt;
          
          cte_next = cte_i + v * sin(epsi_i) * dt;
          
          epsi_next = epsi_i - v * steering_angle * dt / mpc.Lf; 
          

Where:

dt is the time interval

x, y is the x and y coordinates of Car's position.

psi is car's heading direction.

v is velocity.

cte is cross-track error.

epsi is orientation error.

Lf is the distance between the car of mass and the front wheels. 

## MPC 
One of the most important tasks was to tune parameters of the cost function and other parameters for the Model Predictive Controller.

First of all, data about waypoints was transformed into the vehicle space and a 3d order polynomial was fitted to the data. Actual state of the vehicle was "shifted" into the future by 100 ms latency. It helps to reduce negative effects of the latency and increase stability of the controller. The latency was introduced to simulate real delay of a human driver or physical actuators in case of a self driving car. Cross track error and orientation error were calculated, is then they were passed into the MPC routine.

The time horizon (T) was chosen to 2 s after experiments. It was shown that the MPC could drive safely around the track with T = 1 s, but on a slow speed. Higher speed requires more future information to make smart decisions in serial turns. Time step duration (dt) was setted equal to the latancy of the simulation (0.1 s), hense, 20 time steps (N) was used.
